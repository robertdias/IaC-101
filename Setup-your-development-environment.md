# Setting up your development environment 

## Install the sofware needed
To be able to develop ARM templates and GitHub workflows, we recommend you install the following software on your workstation:
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

Click on the links above and install the two packages by following the instructions provided.

Then start VS code and install your favorite extensions. Some of the ones we recommend are listed below:
  * [GitLens â€” Git supercharged](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
  * [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools)
  * [YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)
  * [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)

# Clone your repository

   <img src=".attachments/vs-code-clone.jpg" alt="VScode-clone" title="VScode Clone repo"/>

Then select the folder on your workspation where the repo will be cloned.

You are now ready to create a git branch for yourself in this repo and start contributing code. If you are not familiar with how version control works in Git or how to use it from VScode, please use the links below to ramp up:
